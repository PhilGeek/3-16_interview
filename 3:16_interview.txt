1. What made you become a philosopher?

2. You’ve written extensively about perception, about fiction and colour. You think that perception has an irreducible presentational element. Many think that because of this there’s nothing to be gained from exploring the metaphysics of sensory presentation. You disagree but before turning to your approach, what are the reasons people have for dismissing metaphysics in this area of thinking?

3. So why do you think there is still things to learn from looking at the metaphysics, and why don’t you limit yourself to the orthodox tools of contemporary analytic metaphysics? Is it that you are dissatisfied with an approach that is still largely working within a seventeenth century paradigm?

4. What do you say to a contemporary naturalist metaphysician who derides your approach as a priori armchair philosophising of the worst kind?

5. If you’re not reducing perception generally to sensation by contact, why do you still think that tactile metaphors – and in particular ‘grasping’ -  are still apt in this domain?

6. Can you say why you think phenomenological investigation into haptic experience to uncover this aptness should take the form of conceptual genealogy? (And it may be useful to quickly spell out what you take phenomenology, haptic and genealogy are in this context!)

7. For Empedocles, grasping wasn’t a metaphor was it? Colour perception is literally a type of ingestion isn’t it? So how do you understand what’s happening with these early manifestations of what now seems metaphorical? I think you call your approach ‘conceptual genealogy’ don’t you? Can you say something about this?

8. And why approach things this way – as you say, this is very different to an approach (say of Burnyeat and William)  that supposes that the historical context in  which Aristotle, Empedocles et al worked no longer obtains and so their philosophy of mind is no longer credible? Is it at least partly because you agree with Putnam who thinks modern philosophy of mind a disaster and Aristotle’s approach actually superior to the modern one?

9. How do you push back against the charge that your approach is largely invention and/or anachronistic?

10. You’re doing historically informed speculative metaphysics aren’t you – so how do you go about answering the metaphysical question’ What is it for the object of perception to be present in the perceiver’s experience of it?’

11. How does Heidegger help in this approach – and does that mean that this is continental rather than analytical metaphysics in some sense?

12. You’ve also written about modern fictionalism. Field and van Fraasen are the go-to guys kicking off this element of philosophy. So first, can you set out the territory here – what is modern fictionalism claiming and why is it important? And is it prescriptive or descriptive, and how is different from reductionism and nonfactualism?

13. So is moral fictionalist arguing with the moral realist – and therefore lined up with the non-cognitivist? What makes it distinctive and why do you think the best way of understanding moral commitment – ‘acceptance’ – is using the argument from intransigence? Is it a form of Pyrrhonism?

14. And is disagreement possible in this approach?

15. And finally for the readers here at 3:16, are there five books you can recommend that will take us further into your philosophical world?
