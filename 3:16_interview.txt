1. What made you become a philosopher?

I suppose, in a way, it is connected with my love of reading. I have read as long as I can remember. My mother tells me that when I was three I demanded that she teach me to read. Apparently I was frustrated that she was not always available to read to me, and I must have reasoned that if she taught me to read, I could simply read for myself. I read voraciously and soon exhausted the available age appropriate material. Fortunately there were many books at home. My father was a pathologist and academic who emigrated from Turkey largely out of a concern about rising anti-semitism. So the books at home were mainly medical texts and histories of the Ottoman empire and the Sephardi diaspora. Thus I became accustomed to reading texts that I did not, at first, fully understand. I read a lot of literature and became interested in religious texts. My first encounter with a philosophical text was when I was fourteen. I was in the library of Catholic High School for Boys in Little Rock, Arkansas, just beginning the process of systematically reading its contents, when I encountered Kant's Groundwork. I confess I did not understand it, but I can still recall the vivid sense that I had that this was something important and worth the effort to come to understand. There was not much philosophy in that library. Fortunately, my father would take me to the university library on the weekends where he would research and set me loose in the stacks. Somehow I read existential phenomenology and read Heidegger and Sartre. I was sufficiently enthusiastic that I secured a copy of Being and Nothingness for myself (which I still have, only now replaced by my colleague Sarah Richmond's more recent translation). I went to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. In my first year there I took a course on philosophy of language taught by David Hills (now at Stanford). He spent 6 weeks of the term on Frege. Perhaps strangely, I was hooked and eventually declared philosophy as my major (apparently to my father's embarrassment who would tell his friends that I was studying epistemology banking on their ignorance of that subject and the impressive sound of its name). Michigan was an exciting place for philosophy in the early 80s. When I was there I spoke extensively with Paul Boghossian, David Hills, Kit Fine, Jaegwon Kim, Barry Loewer, Brian McLauglin, and Stephen Yablo. I learned a lot about philosophy of mind, and the then current debates with a primary focus on attempts to naturalize content (such as Fodor's correlational psychosemantics) and Kripke's puzzle about rule-following. Going to graduate school seemed the natural choice, and I went to Princeton where I wrote a dissertation on the philosophy of mathematics.

2. You’ve written extensively about perception, about fiction and colour. You think that perception has an irreducible presentational element. Many think that because of this there’s nothing to be gained from exploring the metaphysics of sensory presentation. You disagree but before turning to your approach, what are the reasons people have for dismissing metaphysics in this area of thinking?

In the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money Keynes wrote: 'Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.' In the same vein I would suggest that practical people, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any metaphysical influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct metaphysics. Whenever a psychologist claims that colors are just biological representations, I think the seventeenth century called, they want their metaphysics back. Nothin in the science establishes that. Only the science in conjunction with unspoken metaphysical assumptions would encourage that thought. We should all strive to critically reflect on the metaphysical assumptions we bring to bear on the philosophical questions we address---even in areas seemingly far removed from metaphysics. An ethicist, say, may make unspoken assumptions about the metaphysics of agency.

3. So why do you think there is still things to learn from looking at the metaphysics, and why don’t you limit yourself to the orthodox tools of contemporary analytic metaphysics? Is it that you are dissatisfied with an approach that is still largely working within a seventeenth century paradigm?

Yes, that is exactly right. If I may switch from Kuhn's vocabulary to Lakatos' (not unrelated since Lakatos was trying to reconcile Popper's insights with Kuhn's), I believe that many philosophers of mind are engaged in a degenerative research program. The so-called Hard Problem of Consciousness is a symptom of this. To get a sense of this, consider a take on that problem independently arrived at by myself, Alex Byrne, and Sydney Shoemaker. Begin with the metaphysics of sensible qualities, specifically the Problem of the Manifest. Suppose you thought that the world that we experience is material. For the sake of vividness, suppose that it is composed of colorless atoms spinning in the void. You might be puzzled, then, about how these give rise to the qualities that we experience. This is a familiar instance of the Problem of the Manifest (compare Eddington's table discussed in his Gifford Lecture). If, in addition, you thought that the subject that experiences these qualities is itself immaterial. A strategy is now open to you for resolving the Problem of the Manifest. There may be nothing qualitative in the material world considered independently of conscious subjects, but there is something qualitative about the experiences that the material world elicits in us. This might lead you to conceive of the colors, say, as the dispositions of material things to elicit color experiences in us. This what Shoemaker describes as kicking the problem upstairs into the mind. But now suppose that you come to conceive of conscious subjects and their experiences as themselves materially realized. The Problem of the Manifest now resurfaces in a new guise, as the Hard Problem of Consciousness. For now you should be puzzled about how conscious experience, given its qualitative character, may be materially puzzled. This is a conceptual cul-de-sac, a pseudo-problem. Some other solution to the original Problem of the Manifest must be sought, and this may require abandoning cherished assumptions that generated. To switch back to Kuhn's vocabulary, a paradigm shift may be required. In my opinion, this will require rethinking both the assumptions that made it puzzling that sensible qualities may be materially realized and assumptions about the nature of sensory experience. Of late, I have been focussing on the latter issue.

4. What do you say to a contemporary naturalist metaphysician who derides your approach as a priori armchair philosophising of the worst kind?

To my face? I doubt you could print my reply. I don't even own an armchair! More seriously, several observations are in order. First, neither I nor such a critic accept the Kantian epistemological categories. Second, I have drawn on the work of art historians, medical historians, historians of science, archaeologists, classicists, psychologists, linguists, and many more. That hardly seems a priori. Third, such criticism needs to be backed by reasons. If not, it is just bullying rhetoric that obscures more than it illuminates. Finally, in the Millian marketplace of ideas, we should judge views by the fruits they bear. If such a naturalist either has no adequate solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness, or merely seeks to evade it by counseling eliminativism, then, in my opinion at least, they are not faring well in that marketplace. Again, at least in the philosophy of mind, they are engaged in a degenerative research program.

But enough of trading insults. Let me sketch how I am trying to rethink the nature of perception shorn of the assumptions that structure the modern paradigm. In a way, I guess I am interested in philosophical ethnography as a form of phenomenology. 

5. If you’re not reducing perception generally to sensation by contact, why do you still think that tactile metaphors – and in particular ‘grasping’ - are still apt in this domain?

I have grappled with this question both in Form without Matter, Empedocles and Aristotle on Color Perception and more directly in Sympathy in Perception. To be honest, I am still grappling with the question, or, at least, I still have more to say about that I shall address in future work. 

But first notice just how widespread the metaphor is. Contemporary philosophers will say that perception puts us into contact with the natural environment. What does this mean? My curiosity was first piqued as an undergraduate. I quickly came to realize that I could not come to understand this simply be examining tactile metaphors deployed by contemporary philosophers. These metaphors are dead in their hands, and will be deployed even when they are in tension with the philosopher's considered views. Why do they grip us so?

6. Can you say why you think phenomenological investigation into haptic experience to uncover this aptness should take the form of conceptual genealogy? (And it may be useful to quickly spell out what you take phenomenology, haptic and genealogy are in this context!)

7. For Empedocles, grasping wasn’t a metaphor was it? Colour perception is literally a type of ingestion isn’t it? So how do you understand what’s happening with these early manifestations of what now seems metaphorical? I think you call your approach ‘conceptual genealogy’ don’t you? Can you say something about this?

8. And why approach things this way – as you say, this is very different to an approach (say of Burnyeat and William)  that supposes that the historical context in  which Aristotle, Empedocles et al worked no longer obtains and so their philosophy of mind is no longer credible? Is it at least partly because you agree with Putnam who thinks modern philosophy of mind a disaster and Aristotle’s approach actually superior to the modern one?

9. How do you push back against the charge that your approach is largely invention and/or anachronistic?

10. You’re doing historically informed speculative metaphysics aren’t you – so how do you go about answering the metaphysical question’ What is it for the object of perception to be present in the perceiver’s experience of it?’

11. How does Heidegger help in this approach – and does that mean that this is continental rather than analytical metaphysics in some sense?

12. You’ve also written about modern fictionalism. Field and van Fraasen are the go-to guys kicking off this element of philosophy. So first, can you set out the territory here – what is modern fictionalism claiming and why is it important? And is it prescriptive or descriptive, and how is different from reductionism and nonfactualism?

13. So is moral fictionalist arguing with the moral realist – and therefore lined up with the non-cognitivist? What makes it distinctive and why do you think the best way of understanding moral commitment – ‘acceptance’ – is using the argument from intransigence? Is it a form of Pyrrhonism?

14. And is disagreement possible in this approach?

15. And finally for the readers here at 3:16, are there five books you can recommend that will take us further into your philosophical world?

First, on the history of philosophy of perception, Theophrastus' De Sensibus translated by George Malcolm Stratton in Theophrastus and the Greek Physiological Psychology before Aristotle, The Macmillan Company, New York, 1917 (though I believe that Katerina Ierodiakonou is working on an updated translation). Theophrastus was Aristotle's student and successor as scholarch of the Lyceum. In this work he is carrying on Aristotle's doxographical project and systematically examines the views of Plato and the pre-Socratics on sense and sensibilia. This is an invaluable resource for understanding philosophy of perception in antiquity.

Second is a more recent history, John I. Beare, Greek Theories of Elementary Cognition, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1906. There is, to date, no fully adequate history of perception in antiquity which is to say that Beare's history has yet to be superseded. Perhaps in time this will change, but until then Beare is an reasonable starting point.

Third is Augustine, De Trinitate. The greatest work in the history of philosophy of mind that philosophers of mind never read. There is a recent translation by Gareth B. Matthews and Stephen McKenna, Augustine On the Trinity Books 8–15, Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2002. But for a full translation there is Arthur West Haddan's translation, On the Trinity, volume 7 of The Works of Aurelius Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, T. & T. Clark, 35 George Street, Edinburgh, 1873.

Fourth, it would be usual to recommend David C. Lindberg's Theories of Vision, From Al-Kindi to Kepler, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1976, a remarkable work that is still worth reading. However, many historians believe that it has been superseded by A. Mark Smith's From Sight to Light, The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 2015. Both narrate the history of philosophy of perception leading up to modernity. If you are going to read one, read the Smith. But read both.

Fifth, something specifically on touch in the phenomenological tradition, Jacques Derrida's On Touching - Jean-Luc Nancy, translated by Christine Irizarry, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2005. The book alternates between criticisms of Nancy and Derrida's notes on touch in the phenomenological tradition understood broadly to include not only phenomenologists such as Husserl but historical figures that are important to that tradition such as Maine de Biran. If reading Derrida makes you impatient, skip the chapters on Nancy and the first few pages (which reads like a surrealist prose poem, though if you read the entire book and return to it, it makes a kind of sense). Derrida's notes on touch, though, are insightful and of value even to those who belong to a different tradition.
